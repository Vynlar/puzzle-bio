        <p>&#128077; Nice job! &#128077;</p> 
        <p>You've just solved a puzzle that stumped me for a long time, so I thought it was great to use as I discuss my learning limitations. Usually my biggest struggle is coming up with creative solutions to problems - and in math and physics, creativity can be your best friend! Another limitation that I face in learning successfully is that I'm stubborn. Learning happens most effectively when you're open to it - which sometimes means that prior knowledge can be the enemy. Leaving pre-concieved notions at the door can be instrumental.</p>
        <p>That said, being stubborn can also be an advantage in that it allows me to stick with something until I actually learn it. The thing that makes me most successful as a learner is my drive to be able to share what I learn with other people. That's why I decided to go to college for physics in the first place - I didn't want to be a physicist, but I did want to inspire the next generation of physicists. And in order to be the best teacher that I can be, I also need to be the best student that I can be. You're never done learning!</p>
        <p>Ready for <a href="puzzle02.html">level 2?</a></p>
