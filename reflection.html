        <p>I set out to learn something that I didn't know and that would be useful - and so I spent my $15 on registering a domain and I got to work creating a website. While still in rough shape now, I hope to continue fleshing out this website as I go forward. I have some things that I could add to it soon - like my CV for instance, and contact information. For now though, it will be my digital autobiography. In doing this, I had to learn some basic HTML and CSS, as well as learning enough GIMP to make that animated GIF at the end! I spent a few hours on this, but it is worth it to me, as I will continue refining it and making this a location for my professional presence. Though, that's a long way away still! I have plans, it's coming!</p>
        <p>I wasn't really sure what to share, so I just went with the basics, and let the technology speak for more. Eventually, I would like to have this hosted on what my website will become, so I can direct future students to it, so this will definitely undergo some revisions. I've always been a fan of having a digital autobiography, I usually introduce myself with a brief set of slides anyway, and I've always wanted to go slightly further with it. I know some people won't like my puzzles, but I tried to make them pretty easy! I guess this was my way of gamifying my introduction. </p>
