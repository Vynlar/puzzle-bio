        <p>&#x1F389;  Woohoo! You made it through my puzzles - I hope you had fun doing it! &#x1F389;</p>
        <p>Outside of being a learner and a teacher, I do manage to have a few hobbies. The photos in that last puzzle were of me geocaching to complete a challenge called "Cache Across America". There is one particular geocache hidden in each of the 50 states that you must find and collect a secret code from - you use these codes to solve for the coordinates of the final in Washington DC. So far I've found 32 of them - but I have managed to visit all 50 states! I love to road trip, which means I've travelled tons within the US, but not abroad.</p>
        <p>Part of what I do when I travel is escape rooms! I mentioned that I love puzzles, and escape rooms are how I usually get my fix. If I weren't a student, I would be working at an escape room. I also love games, and to me an escape room is a game that I have to beat. I've done something like 65 rooms now, and I only have 1 failure. It mocks me.</p>
