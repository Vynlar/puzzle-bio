        <p>Morse code is one of my favorite puzzles because it can be used in so many different ways. Morse code is used to transmit language using electrical pulses and the gaps between them. The origin of Morse code goes back to around 1837 - only 37 years after the first reliable battery was able to produce a steady current at all! You've just found something that I value while I'm teaching, and that's grounding lessons in a historical context. If nothing else, it provides students with additional opportunities to make connections with the material.</p>
        <p>I know that most people view physics as "hard" or "only for smart people", so one of my favorite things to do in class is to demonstrate that I'm not above them. Sure, I've studied the topic longer than my students have, but there is nothing preventing my students from being able to do physics too. One way that I do this, is I try to keep my classes relatively informal and myself approachable.</p>
